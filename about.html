<h2 style="color:AliceBlue;">Why, When, How</h2>
<p style="color:Azure;">I've chosen this topic because lately I've been interested for the past 2 years in gaining more academic knowlage</p>
<p style="color:Azure;"> and improving myself so that I can achive my dream of studying abroad and I'm always saerching for student activities and opportunities,</p>
<p style="color:Azure;">education fairs and summits, courses, internships, scholarships all to help me improve my resume and gain more academic and soft skills.</p>
<p style="color:Azure;">I am always looking for these things and searching online so I made this website to help other students find what they're looking for</p>
